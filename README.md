# NaNoGenMo2022
Code to generate a book of at least 50,000 words.

## Initial thoughts and ideas

- output MDZS fic, because I think it would be amusing
- play somehow with randomly-selecting chengyu
  - for per-chapter vibes? for dialogue? something more de/reconstructive?
  - for this, I need to find an appropriately-licensed list of chengyu with EN translations (https://www.regine-traduction.com/proverbes-chinois.php#haut) would be wonderful, but is not open)
- are there useful corpora for this specific setting? maybe look at wikipedia for list of hanfu items, fandom wiki for list of weapons/spiritual items, characters etc.
- find list of tags belonging to this fandom on AO3
- possibly markovify a selection of fics and use that somehow
- or at least find some interestingly over-represented words
